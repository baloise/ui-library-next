# Write your own Component

All our components are located in the `src/components` dir.

To create a new one just run:

```bash
npm run generate
```

!> Every component in this project should start with the prefix `bal-`.

Change the extension of the generated `bal-component.css` file to `bal-component.scss` and update it in the `bal-component.tsx` file aswell.
